## Overview
Customers have taken note of the wizardry of LoanStreet's solutions,

## Discussion

This project will assist fellow engineers in getting to know you and your work.
It is intentionally left open-ended to allow you the flexibility to create your
best product using whatever tools you wish.
That said, please do not hesitate to ask questions and request clarifications.

An engineer will debrief and review this code with you as part of the
interview process.  Please be prepared to answer questions such as:
* What are the strengths and weaknesses of ABC framework?
* How is XYZ persistence layer well-suited to your data model?
* What situations may result in failure?
